Scoreloop Integration - Show integration with BPS event system - v1.0.09

========================================================================
Using a managed project vs. using a makefile project

This package contains two different types of project options. One is an eclipse-based
managed project and the other is a makefile project. The managed project leverages
Eclipse to manage the build process so that you donít have to worry about makefiles.
When using this option you can adjust build settings through the project properties.
The makefile project allows you to see and edit makefiles for direct control of the
build process.

========================================================================
